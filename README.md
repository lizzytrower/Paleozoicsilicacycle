# Paleozoicsilicacycle

These models were designed by Lizzy Trower (CU Boulder) using Matlab 2018b as simple tools 
to estimate fluxes and Si isotope compositions (d30Si) for the Paleozoic marine silica cycle. 
The model was modified after versions described in De La Rocha and Bickle (2015) and Frings 
et al. (2016). Each section of the code runs a different version described in the text of 
Trower et al. (submitted manuscript). The first section is commented; the remaining sections 
are structured identically, and just differ in terms of the ODE math and some additional 
parameters.
